Token Sale Model
----------------

Egal ob ein Projekt Thrash ist oder nicht, es kann trotzdem ein gutes Token Sale Model haben.
Ich liste hier mal Möglichkeiten auf.

Specify the problem
-------------------
1. Certainty of valuation - if you participate in a sale, you should have certainty over at least a ceiling on the valuation (or, in other words, a floor on the percentage of all tokens you are getting).
2. Certainty of participation - if you try to participate in a sale, you should be able to generally count on succeeding.
3. Capping the amount raised - to avoid being perceived as greedy (or possibly to mitigate risk of regulatory attention), the sale should have a limit on the amount of money it is collecting.
4. No central banking - the token sale issuer should not be able to end up with an unexpectedly very large percentage of the tokens that would give them control over the market.
5. Efficiency - the sale should not lead to substantial economic inefficiencies or deadweight losses.

1 + 2 = Dilemma, cannot be satified simultanously
3,4,5 = Dilemma, at least without resorting to very clever tricks, cannot be satisfied simultaneously.

Possible Solutions
------------------
1. First, you can do a reverse dutch auction just like Gnosis, but with one change: instead of holding the unsold tokens, put them toward some kind of public good. 
2. Second, you can keep the unsold tokens, but solve the “central banking” problem by committing to a fully automated plan for how they would be spent. 
3. Third, you can do a capped sale, where you limit the amount that can be bought by each person. 

Alternativen zu Single Round Sales
- Micro-Rounds of uncapped Sales everyday for a year or so (angelshares)
- Micro Sale, six month prior to the big one
- Market Maker

Modelle
-------
- Capped Sales (Fix Number of Tokens at a fixed Price)
- Uncapped Sales
- Hybrid capped Sales
- Reverse Dutch Auctions
- Vickrey Auctions
- Proportional Refunds

Failures
- Maidsafe,  (running a sale that accepts multiple currencies at a fixed exchange rate is dangerous and bad. Don’t do it)
- Ethereum, uncapped ( Nearly every uncapped sale is criticized for being “greedy” (a criticism I have significant reservations about))
- BAT, capped (Because of Fomo, developers had 90% of token - and can act like a central bank)
